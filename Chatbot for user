NLP approach for chatbot:
Description:
We will be using NLTK library for NLP .
Using POS tagging first we will come to know about parts of speech used in the sentences
After POS tagging we will remove stop words form our sentences,to get he clear picture.
We will be targeting noun and verb to understand whether that is question or statement.
After removing stop words the sentence with left words,will undergo probability test with the corpus we have.
If the probability is high we will give the answer 
Else the chatbot with promt user that did you mean this
if NO ,then further analysis has to happen.


How chatbot will  interact with user
It will start with greeting
It will tell his name and ask about users name
Sometimes user can start with emoticon,chabot should understand that
If user doesnot responds within some time ,pop up message will come.
If the same question is repetaed again ,it can ask user not to repeat question or tell diff answer everytime


For making corpus
Chatbot should have ability to scrap website using(Beautiful soap)and keep all the questions and answers.
